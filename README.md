# EightDaysTraining
This is a table that helps you to learn. You can save any information you want with this table.
For example, you want to learn a language.
You enter the title of the phrase you want to learn.
Je m'appelle
Then you tick the first house. The next day, the phrase
Je m'appelle
you ask yourself and if you know its meaning, you tick it again for the second day, and if you don't know, you cross it.
In this way, you can continue the same work for eight days, if at the end of the eight days, all the houses in the table were not turned into ticks.
You have to keep practicing for a few more days until all eight houses become ticks. In this way, you can be sure that you have learned the desired word.
